			<p>
				<em>The Simpsons</em> is an American animated sitcom created by
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Groening" target="_blank">Matt Groening</a>
				for the <a href="https://www.fox.com/" target="_blank">Fox Broadcasting Company</a>.
				The series is a satirical depiction of American life, epitomized by the Simpson family,
				which consists of
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_Simpson" target="_blank">Homer</a>,
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marge_Simpson" target="_blank">Marge</a>,
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_Simpson" target="_blank">Bart</a>,
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Simpson" target="_blank">Lisa</a> and
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_Simpson" target="_blank">Maggie</a>.
				The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture and
				society, television, and the human condition.

		The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated
		shorts with producer
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Brooks" target="_blank">James L. Brooks</a>.
		He created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after his own family members,
		substituting Bart for his own name; he thought Simpson was a funny name in that it sounded
		similar to "simpleton". The shorts became a part of
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tracey_Ullman_Show" target="_blank">The Tracey
		Ullman Show</a> on April 19, 1987. After three seasons, the sketch was developed into a
		half-hour prime time show and became Fox's first series to land in the top 30 ratings in a
		season (1989-1990).

	<h2 id="characters">Characters</h2>
	<p>
		<em>The Simpsons</em> is known for its wide ensemble of main and supporting characters
		(ensemble cast).
	</p>
	<p>
		The main characters are the Simpson family, who live in a fictional "Middle America" town of
		Springfield.
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_Simpson" target="_blank">Homer</a>, the father,
		works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position at odds with
		his careless, buffoonish personality. He is married to
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marge_Simpson" target="_blank">Marge Bouvier</a>,
		a stereotypical American housewife and mother. They have three children:
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_Simpson" target="_blank">Bart</a>,
		a ten-year-old troublemaker and prankster;
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Simpson" target="_blank">Lisa</a>,
		a precocious eight-year-old activist; and
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_Simpson" target="_blank">Maggie</a>,
		the baby of the family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a pacifier.
		Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds
		with each other and they are often shown to care about one another. Homer's dad
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grampa_Simpson" target="_blank">Grampa Simpson</a>
		lives in the Springfield Retirement Home after Homer forced his dad to sell his house so
		that his family could buy theirs. Grampa Simpson has had starring roles in several episodes.
	</p>
	<p>
		The family also owns a dog, <em>Santa's Little Helper</em>, and a cat, <em>Snowball V</em>.
		Both pets have had starring roles in several episodes.
	</p>

	<h2 id="setting">Setting</h2>
	<p>
		<em>The Simpsons</em> takes place in the fictional American town of Springfield in an
		unknown and impossible-to-determine U.S. state. The show is intentionally evasive in regard
		to Springfield's location. Springfield's geography, and that of its surroundings, contains
		coastlines, deserts, vast farmland, tall mountains, or whatever the story or joke requires.
		Groening has said that Springfield has much in common with Portland, Oregon, the city where
		he grew up. The name "Springfield" is a common one in America and appears in at least 29
		states. Groening has said that he named it after Springfield, Oregon, and the fictitious
		Springfield which was the setting of the series Father Knows Best. He "figured out that
		Springfield was one of the most common names for a city in the U.S. In anticipation of the
		success of the show, I thought, 'This will be cool; everyone will think it's their
		Springfield.' And they do."
	</p>

	<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
	<p>
		Despite the depiction of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays passing, the
		characters never age between episodes (either physically or in stated age), and generally
		appear just as they did when the series began. The series uses a floating timeline in which
		episodes generally take place in the year the episode is produced even though the characters
		do not age. Flashbacks and flashforwards do occasionally depict the characters at other
		points in their lives, with the timeline of these depictions also generally floating
		relative to the year the episode is produced. For example, in the 1991 episode "I Married
		Marge", Bart (who is always 10 years old) appears to be born in 1980 or 1981. But in the
		1995 episode "And Maggie Makes Three", Maggie (who always appears to be around 1 year old)
		appears to be born in 1993 or 1994. In the 1992 episode "Lisa's First Word", Lisa (who is
		always 8) is shown to have been born in 1984.
